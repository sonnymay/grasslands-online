## 1. Project overview

**Grasslands Online** — browser-based 2D MMORPG inspired by Ragnarok Online.
Original name, original art, original code, copyright-safe.

- **Owner:** Sonny (GitHub: `sonnymay`)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/sonnymay/grasslands-online (public)
- **Live prod:** https://grasslands-online.vercel.app
- **Local repo root:** `/Users/santipapmay/Documents/Grasslands Online`
- **Playable subfolder (Vercel `outputDirectory`):** `project-grasslands/`
- **Engine:** Phaser 3.70 from CDN
- **Language:** plain JavaScript + HTML, **no build step, no npm packages**
- **Art:** ChatGPT image-gen, anime 2D, no pixel art

### Run locally

```bash
cd "/Users/santipapmay/Documents/Grasslands Online/project-grasslands"
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Claude Code preview server: `mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_start` name
`grasslands` (port 8001; configured in
`/Users/santipapmay/Documents/Grasslands Online/.claude/launch.json` with
`--directory project-grasslands`).

### Deployment

- Vercel auto-deploys on every push to `main` via the GitHub integration.
- `vercel.json` at repo root sets `outputDirectory: project-grasslands`,
  no build/install command, and these cache headers:
  - `index.html` + `game.js` → `max-age=0, must-revalidate`
  - `assets/(.*)` → `max-age=31536000, immutable`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `node -c` on `game.js` and a smoke fetch
  on each push.
- `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml` is a **manual** fallback workflow.
- `DEPLOY.md` at repo root has the production URL, project IDs, and
  step-by-step Vercel setup notes.

### Controls

- Click ground → A* path → walk.
- Click a monster → walk into range + auto-attack until target dies. No
  re-clicks needed.
- `Tab` → target nearest live monster.
- `Shift+R` → wipe localStorage save and reload.
- **No WASD, no arrow keys, no skill hotkeys, no camera shake.** All
  intentionally removed at user request.

---

## 2. Current state — what works right now

### Movement
- 32 px logical cell grid (`CELL_SIZE = 32`, `GRID_COLS/ROWS = 100`) over the
  3200×3200 world. 128 px display tiles draw on top via `buildMap`.
- 8-direction A* (`findPath`, octile heuristic, diagonal-squeeze guard) with
  `MAX_PATH_LEN = 256` and an 8 000-iteration cap.
- Player position lerps cell-to-cell at `MS_PER_CELL = 170`. Sprite Y is
  offset by a full-sine bob (`BOB_AMPLITUDE = 3`) plus a 10% vertical squash
  for foot-fall feel.
- Animation cycles **4 walk frames per direction** when all walk3/walk4
  textures load. `_pickWalkFrame()` auto-detects, falls back to 2-frame.
  Frame cadence ≈ `WALK_FRAME_MS = 120` per frame.
- 8-direction sprite art for N/S/E/SE/NE. SW/NW/W = horizontally-flipped
  versions of E/SE/NE via `DIR_TEXTURE` map.
- Click marker (fading green ring) shows the target spot on every move.
- Hit stun: 200 ms of frozen movement after being damaged.

### Combat (fully auto)
- Click monster → A* to a cell adjacent to it, attack on cooldown until dead.
- Player ATK 10 (+ level scaling). ±20 % damage variance per swing.
- 3 % critical hit (×2, yellow `-N!`, big text, rich SFX).
- 5 % player whiff, 10 % monster whiff → `MISS` floats.
- DEF reduces incoming dmg, min 1.
- Tab cycles target. Persistent red ellipse ring sits under the current
  target.
- Auto-attack is range-aware: when target steps out of range player repaths
  to an adjacent cell; when in range the path is cleared so the player
  plants and swings.

### Player progression
- HP regen: 2 % maxHP every 3 s, paused while stunned.
- EXP threshold = `level × 100`. On level-up: +20 maxHP, +3 ATK, +1 DEF,
  full heal, jingle, `LEVEL UP!` text.
- Death: lose 5 % of `expNeeded()`, respawn at spawn cell after 3 s with
  full HP.

### Monsters (`MONSTER_TYPES` table)
Each entry now has a `zones: [...]` whitelist; `spawnMonster()` rejects
spawns outside the listed zones.

| Type | HP | ATK | EXP | Speed | Count | Zone(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `blobling` | 50 | 5 | 10 | 80 | 30 | grasslands | Pink slime |
| `mooham` | 80 | 8 | 18 | 70 | 20 | grasslands, ruins | Pig |
| `moowaan` | 60 | 6 | 14 | 90 | 15 | forest, riverside | scaleMult 0.9 |
| `dune_blob` | 70 | 7 | 16 | 85 | 12 | desert | Tinted blobling (0xe8c878) until real cactling art is wired |
| `boss_mooham` | 240 | 16 | 90 | 55 | 1 | desert | Far-zone challenge, scaleMult 1.9 |
| `bigfoot` | 900 | 220 | 500 | 45 | 1 | forest | **Forest boss**, fixed level 50, no scaling, aggressive (520 px aggro), one-shots players below lv 50. Uses `aggroKey/chaseKey/attackKey/idleKey` extra textures. |

All monsters are **passive**. They only chase + attack the player after
being hit (`provoked` flag, drops after 5 s of no damage). Monster level
1–3 rolled per spawn (weighted 65/27/8); HP / ATK / EXP scale with level.
On death: 1.5 s dead pose → despawn → respawn 5 s later via
`spawnMonster(typeId)`, with a white "puff" ring effect.

### Loot
- Every monster drop: zeny coin (60–160 % of EXP reward), bounces in,
  pulses to be visible.
- 15 % chance: extra green healing herb (+20–35 HP).
- Pickup radius 28 px; auto-collected when walking over.
- Soft ground shadow under every monster / loot for grounding.

### UI
- Bottom bar: red HP bar (left), purple EXP bar (centre), Lv + Zeny (right).
- Chat box, bottom-left, last 10 messages.
- Mini-map, top-right, 160×160 px: white = player, red = Blobling,
  orange = MooHam, green = MooWaan, large yellow = Boss MooHam,
  small yellow = loot. Faint dirt path drawn under markers.
- Floating damage numbers: white (to player), red (to enemy), yellow
  bigger+`!` (crit), grey (`MISS`).
- Player HP bar above sprite, hidden at full HP.

### Day/night
- Cosine-driven darkness overlay, 2-minute loop, max alpha 0.45.
- Implemented as a `scrollFactor 0` fullscreen rect at depth 9000.

### Persistence
- `localStorage[grasslands_save_v2]` auto-saves every 3 s and on level-up.
  Bumped from `v1` when the world doubled — old saves had cells in a
  100×100 grid and would land in the wrong zone in the 200×200 world.
- Saves: `level, exp, hp, maxHP, atk, def, zeny, kills, cellCol, cellRow`.
- On load: position falls back to spawn if the saved cell is now blocked
  by decorations.
- `Shift+R` wipes the save and reloads.

### Audio
- **WebAudio synthesised SFX**, no asset files: footstep scuff, melee hit
  (noise + descending square thud), critical (noise sweep + bell stack +
  bass), miss, player-hit, level-up jingle, pickup, death.
- **Background music**: `assets/audio/bgm.mp3` (4 MB). Preloaded by Phaser,
  built with `sound.add('bgm', { loop: true, volume: 0.35 })`. Tries to
  play on scene create; falls back to first pointerdown / keydown if the
  browser blocks autoplay.

### Map
- **6400×6400 world, 50×50 tile grid, 200×200 cell grid.** 4× the original
  Phase-1 footprint. A* iteration cap raised to 32 000.
- **5 themed zones** (`getZone(r, c)`) carved around a central grasslands
  core (~9 tiles either side of map center):
  - **grasslands** (center) — original mix, no tint, all standard deco
  - **forest** (N) — heavy trees, dark bushes, green tint `0x6b8a5a`
  - **desert** (S) — sparse rocks, yellow tint `0xe8c878`
  - **ruins** (W) — heavy rocks + dead bushes, grey tint `0xb0a890`
  - **riverside** (E) — ponds + flowers + trees, blue-green tint `0xa8c8b0`
- Tile + decoration tints applied via `setTint` on the existing
  `grass_tileset` until real per-biome tilesets ship. **Sand tileset PNG
  already exists** (`assets/tiles/sand_tileset.png`) but is not yet wired.
- Mini-map gets a sampled zone backdrop so all 5 biomes read at a glance.
- Centre cross dirt path (horizontal + vertical mid-row / mid-col).
  Path tiles also tint to blend with biome. Plain grass tiles use
  GRASS / THICK_GRASS, random flipX/flipY to break the 128 px grid.
- Decoration scatter overlay (`buildDecorations`):
  - 220 tall-grass clumps
  - 110 flower clusters
  - 90 mushrooms
  - 70 bushes (cell-blocking radius 1)
  - 35 trees (cell-blocking radius 2)
  - 3 ponds (cell-blocking radius 3)
  - Rock PNGs are loaded but **commented out** of placement.
- Spawn cell + a 3×3 area around it always forced walkable post-scatter so
  the player never starts inside a tree.
- Source PNGs lack alpha → `keyOutWhite()` strips near-white pixels at
  runtime via canvas. Skipped silently if a texture is missing.

## 3. What we did in session 5 (latest, in order)

1. **World doubled** to 6400×6400 (200×200 cells, 50×50 tiles). A* iter
   cap 8 000 → 32 000.
2. **5-zone biome system** added via `getZone(r, c)` — central grasslands
   core, outer ring partitioned by compass direction into forest (N),
   desert (S), ruins (W), riverside (E).
3. **Per-zone tile tinting**: `ZONE_TINTS` map applied via `setTint` in
   `buildMap` so existing grass tileset visually differentiates biomes.
4. **Per-zone decoration scatter**: `buildDecorations` accepts a
   `zoneFilter` opts param and runs separate placement passes per biome
   (trees-heavy forest, rocky desert + ruins, ponds + flowers riverside).
   The `deco_rock_01..03` PNGs now actually get placed.
5. **Dune Blob monster** added — recoloured Blobling sprite via
   `tint: 0xe8c878` on the MonsterController, desert-only.
6. **Bigfoot forest boss** added (Codex change, committed in same wave):
   fixed lv 50, 900 HP, 220 ATK, aggressive aggro, one-shots players
   below lv 50, uses extra textures (`aggro/chase/attack`).
7. **Mini-map zone backdrop** — 16×16 sample grid colours every cell by
   `getZone()`, plus Bigfoot gets a black-outlined red marker so the
   boss is visible from anywhere on the map.
8. **Save key bumped to v2** so 100×100-coord saves don't land players in
   the wrong zone in the 200×200 world.
9. **Asset compression via `sips --resampleHeightWidthMax`** — every PNG
   downscaled (tilesets cap 768, sprites + decorations cap 512). Total
   assets dropped from **~96 MB → ~34 MB** (≈65 % cut). Lossless visual
   quality at current display sizes (96–240 px). pngquant not used —
   `brew install` blocked, sips was sufficient.
10. **New desert art generated but not yet wired:** `sand_tileset.png`,
    `desert_props.png`, `cactus_set.png`, `deco_sand_dune.png`,
    `cactling_idle.png`/`hit`/`dead`. Compressed but still untracked.
    See §4 #1.
11. Cache buster bumped to **`?v=43`** (`v=42` shipped the zone system,
    `v=43` ships the compressed assets).
12. **`.claude/launch.json` switched** to `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13`
    because the bundled Python 3.9 hits `PermissionError: getcwd()` in
    the sandbox. Absolute path to project dir baked into args.

---

## 4. Next steps (pick any)

1. **Wire the new desert art (biggest visual win — assets already in
   repo, just untracked).**
   - `cactling_{idle,hit,dead}.png` → swap the `dune_blob` entry in
     `MONSTER_TYPES` to use these keys, remove the `tint:` line, rename
     to `cactling`. Preload + keyOutWhite + minimap entry.
   - `sand_tileset.png` → load as a second tileset key, branch in
     `buildMap` so desert tiles draw from `sand_tileset` instead of a
     tinted `grass_tileset`. Cactus + dune deco get their own placement
     pass in `buildDecorations` desert section, removing the
     `rockKeys`/`grass_tileset` desert tint.
   - `desert_props.png` is a multi-prop sheet — needs slicing in
     `preload()` similar to how `grass_tileset` is sliced into 16 keys.
   - `git add` the new files when wiring.
2. **More compression headroom.** sips downscale brought us 96 → 34 MB.
   `pngquant --quality=70-85` on top would lossy-cut another 40–60 %
   without visible damage. Requires `brew install pngquant` (was blocked
   in session 5; run manually next time).
3. **Walk polish (still open).** Verify in browser that the 4-frame cycle
   `['walk','walk2','walk3','walk4']` reads as L → pass → R → pass in
   **every** direction. Codex's `dafed39` added direction-specific frame
   ordering. If a direction still slides, reorder per-direction inside
   `_pickWalkFrame()` or reject bad frames with a per-frame Y offset.
4. **Verify BGM in production** — refresh the Vercel URL, click once,
   confirm music loops cleanly. If autoplay never starts, surface a
   one-time "Click to start music" button.
5. **Zone transitions / portals** — current paths cross the whole map
   naturally, but adding visible biome boundary markers (stone arches,
   wooden signs, palette gradient tiles at zone edges) would sell the
   "you entered the desert" feeling without scene changes.
6. **More monsters per zone** — pattern is well-trodden. Add to
   `MONSTER_TYPES` with a `zones: [...]` field, drop sprites at
   `assets/sprites/<name>_idle/hit/dead.png`, mini-map colour in
   `drawMinimap()`.
7. **Walk audio per surface** (grass vs dirt vs sand vs stone) — use
   `getZone()` at the player's cell to pick the footstep tone.
8. **Two-stage preload** — essentials (player + tileset + first monster)
   start the scene immediately, decorations load after
   `scene.scene.start()` and pop in when ready. Largest engineering
   change but kills the green-screen wait entirely.

---

## 5. Known issues / quirks

- **Asset weight** — now **~34 MB** of PNGs (down from 96 MB after
  sips downscale in session 5). Acceptable on broadband; mobile / slow
  links still see a multi-second load. Vercel caches assets `immutable`
  so repeat visitors are instant. Loading bar shows progress.
  `pngquant` would cut another 40–60 % when the user installs it.
- **Tinted-tile biomes look muddy.** Multiplying `0xe8c878` over the
  saturated green tileset gives olive, not sand. The right fix is real
  per-biome tilesets — `sand_tileset.png` is already on disk waiting to
  be wired (§4 #1).
- **Bigfoot one-shots low-level players.** Forest is the closest biome
  to spawn (player walks N from grasslands core). Until levelling
  catches players up to 50, the forest is effectively a death zone.
  Consider either (a) gating Bigfoot spawn behind a kill-count flag, or
  (b) moving Bigfoot to the far edge of the forest.
- `keyOutWhite()` strips any near-white pixel — will damage future art
  with intentional whites. Prefer art with real alpha and remove the hack
  one day.
- Tile seams: mitigated by 4 % inset crop + 2 px overdraw. Still faintly
  visible at some camera positions.
- No world collisions beyond `setCollideWorldBounds` for monsters. Player
  uses cell-based A* and respects the `walkable` grid.
- A* recomputes every repath; fine at 100×100 with the iteration cap.
- Mini-map redraws every frame.
- Phaser banner spams the console on every reload. Cosmetic.
- `?v=N` cache-bust lives in `index.html`. Bump on every `game.js`
  change. Current: **`?v=43`**. Next change should use `?v=44`.
- `.vercel/` is gitignored. `node_modules/`, `*.log`, `.claude/`, and
  `.DS_Store` are also ignored.

## 7. Assets

### Sprites — `project-grasslands/assets/sprites/`

| File pattern | Files | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `rookie_idle_{south,north,east,southeast,northeast}.png` | 5 | Player idle, 8-dir base |
| `rookie_walk{,2,3,4}_<dir>.png` | 5 × 4 = 20 | 4-frame walk cycle, 8-dir via flip |
| `rookie_attack.png` | 1 | 250 ms swing flash |

| `cactling_{idle,hit,dead}.png` | 3 | **Untracked, not yet wired.** Replacement for tinted Dune Blob in desert. |

### Decorations — `project-grasslands/assets/decorations/`

| File pattern | Files | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `deco_flower_cluster_01..04.png` | 4 | Random scatter on grass |
| `deco_tallgrass_01..03.png` | 3 | Random scatter on grass |
| `deco_rock_01..03.png` | 3 | Now placed in desert + ruins zones |
| `cactus_set.png` | 1 | **Untracked, not yet wired.** Multi-cactus PNG for desert. |
| `deco_sand_dune.png` | 1 | **Untracked, not yet wired.** Sandy mound deco. |
| `desert_props.png` | 1 | **Untracked, not yet wired.** Multi-prop sheet (rocks/bones/signpost) — needs slicing like the tileset. |
| `mushroom_red_01.png`, `mushroom_brown_02.png` | 2 | Decoration only |
| `bush_01.png`, `bush_02.png` | 2 | Block radius 1 |
| `tree_oak_01.png`, `tree_pine_02.png`, `tree_round_03.png` | 3 | Block radius 2 |
| `pond_01.png` | 1 | Block radius 3 |

### Tiles — `project-grasslands/assets/tiles/`

- `grass_tileset.png` — 4×4 grid (16 tiles), sliced with a 4 % inset
  crop, drawn `TILE_SIZE + 2` to hide subpixel seams. Downscaled to
  768 px longest side in session 5.
- `sand_tileset.png` — **Untracked, not yet wired.** Companion to
  `grass_tileset.png`; same 4×4 layout but desert palette. Wire as a
  second key in `preload()` and branch in `buildMap()` per zone.

### Audio — `project-grasslands/assets/audio/`

- `bgm.mp3` 4 MB — loop background music (volume 0.35).
- Folder also contains `.gitkeep` for cases where the mp3 is removed.

### ChatGPT prompts

Always include `transparent background PNG with alpha channel`. The
`keyOutWhite()` runtime hack is a fallback for art without real alpha.

## 8. GitHub + Vercel workflow (enforced)

- Commit **after every meaningful change**.
- Conventional prefixes only: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `tweak:`,
  `docs:`, `chore:`, `asset:`.
- Subject ≤ 72 chars, present tense, no trailing period.
- Bump `?v=N` in `index.html` whenever `game.js` changes. Current `?v=43`.
- Run `node -c project-grasslands/game.js` before pushing.
- Never end a session with uncommitted changes. Final action: clean
  `git status`, HANDOFF.md refreshed, both pushed.
- Vercel re-deploys automatically on `main`.

---

## 9. How to continue (do this first in a new session)

1. **Read this file in full.** No skimming.
2. From repo root run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to confirm
   tree clean and see recent work.
3. Boot preview:
   - `cd project-grasslands && python3 -m http.server 8000`, **or**
   - `mcp__Claude_Preview__preview_start` name `grasslands` (port 8001).
4. Visit the preview, walk around, kill a Blobling, check HP regen,
   confirm the loader overlay appears + hides cleanly. Confirm music
   plays after the first click. Test by visiting prod
   https://grasslands-online.vercel.app.
5. Pick a task from §4 or whatever the user asks.
6. **Per change:** edit → bump `?v=N` → `node -c` parse → reload →
   conventional commit → push. Vercel re-deploys automatically.
7. **End of session:** update §3, §4, §5, §7 in this file. Commit
   `HANDOFF.md`, push. Then stop.

---

## 10. Constraints (do NOT re-add)

The user has explicitly cut these features. Re-adding them is regressive:

- WASD / arrow-key movement.
- Skill hotkeys (Power Strike, Self-Heal).
- SP stat + SP bar.
- HealerNPC (the blue `+` circle near spawn).
- Camera shake on hit.
- Toggleable stat panel overlay (`C` key).

Combat is intentionally **fully automatic** after a single click on a
monster.
